# Basu Input Buffer (Geode)

## Get the .geode file without installing anything
1. Create a free GitHub repo and upload everything in this folder (keep the .github folder).
2. Open the Actions tab, run "Build Mod" (or just push).
3. When it finishes, download "Build Output" and take the .geode file.
4. Put it in your Geode mods folder (or drag onto the GD window).

## Build locally instead
Install the Geode CLI and SDK, then run:  geode build

## Keys (Windows)
F6 cycle stage | F9 open/close the in-game console | F10 path view | F11 forget this level's memory

## Android64 (GD 2.2081)
The same .geode (built by the workflow's Android64 job) works on Android 64-bit. There are no F-keys on a phone, so the four actions are buttons in the **pause menu**: Stage (F6), Console (F9), Path (F10) and Forget (F11). The status line above the buttons shows the current stage.
Everything else (prediction ghost, wave / robot / spider / ship / orb / dash logic, level memory, unlocked FPS) is platform-independent and works the same.
Differences: the separate Windows console window does not exist on Android (the "Debug console" setting writes the log to Geode's log instead). Phones are slower than PCs, so if you get stutter, lower "Prediction time budget (ms)" and the lookahead settings.

Edit "yourname" in mod.json first. Practice use only; do not use for verified or leaderboard runs.

## v2.4 options (mod settings)
- Wave auto-release (practice only, off by default): lets go for you when holding would crash within the window and letting go survives.
- Orbs: also try the other choice: if a prediction dies after touching an orb, it is retried with the opposite click/skip choice.
- Don't buffer near moving objects (experimental, off by default): inputs are left untouched when the ghost's path hits recently moved spikes/blocks.
- Drift check (debug): logs in the in-game console how far you strayed from the prediction after each input.
- Wave (v2.7): cube-style. A crash you could still turn away from counts as safe; the smallest delay that clears the obstacle wins; inputs during a delay keep their rhythm. "Wave: old v4.6 logic" brings back the v4.6 rules. Platformer levels are never buffered.
- Orb alignment (v2.6): a press made up to 4 frames before an orb is held back until you're inside the orb, so it hits.
- v2.8: the ghost copies the full player state (slopes, reverse, sideways, forces, dash), size portals are simulated and mirror portals no longer stop the prediction.
- v2.10: wave tries 3 turn-away points, stops runs as soon as they are good enough (faster), and centers saves with a 1-tick safety margin. Console is see-through.
- v2.12 robot: presses count as safe if some hold length survives; robot auto-release (practice only).
- v2.13 level memory: learns per spot from your runs (delays that worked are tried first, spots where saves failed are left alone, risky spots marked in the path view).
- v2.15 spider: flips are judged by landing on the new surface, and crashes you could flip away from count as safe.
- v2.16 orbs: orbs usable on any tick inside them in predictions, orb alignment picks the best tick inside the orb, dash orbs held through in predictions, dash releases buffered, dash auto-release.
- v2.23 unlocked FPS: all windows (look-ahead, delays, landing, spam gap, auto-release window, memory) are converted from 240/s ticks to the real physics step rate, and the ghost uses the average step length.
- v2.24 FPS: prediction ghosts no longer spawn visual effects or leave nodes/actions behind (the FPS used to sink a little with every save).
- v2.25 ship (opt-in): ship presses/releases buffered with recovery-aware scoring, own small max delay, feathering passes through.
- v2.26 orb timing: presses already inside an orb are re-timed within the orb if that survives, learned orb timings are tried first, predictions try later clicks inside orbs.
- v2.27: late cube/ball crashes skip the search; experimental moving-object prediction (straight-line motion).
